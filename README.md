# Youtube-ads-simulator
This API-powered mini project allows users to input any YouTube channel ID and receive a prediction of the ad categories likely to be shown, based purely on video metadata (title + description). It mimics ad targeting logic using basic NLP and keyword matching to demonstrate how contextual ads may be inferred from content.
